Fantastic — both of these are not only **clever and relevant** to the job hunt, but also give your team a chance to show off natural language processing, JSON handling, and testable Python logic.

Here’s a full breakdown for both projects, with feature lists, suggested endpoints, and real `pytest` unit test examples.

## 📝 Project 1: Resume Keyword Matcher & Skill Gap Checker

### 🌟 Project Goal

> User pastes a resume and a job description. The backend compares them and returns:

* Skills/keywords that match
* Keywords in the job listing that are *missing* in the resume
* Optional: resources to learn the missing skills

---

### 🔧 Backend Architecture (Python Flask or FastAPI)

* `POST /match_keywords`

  * Body: `{ "resume": "...", "job_description": "..." }`
  * Returns:

    ```json
    {
      "matched": ["Python", "REST", "Git"],
      "missing": ["AWS", "Docker", "CI/CD"]
    }
    ```
* Optional: `GET /skills_resources?skills=["AWS","Docker"]`

  * Returns URLs or short blurbs on learning resources

---

### 🔎 Keyword Matching Logic (Python)

* Clean both resume and job desc (remove punctuation, lowercase, split)
* Compare against a **predefined keyword list** (e.g., from a CSV or static list)
* Use `set()` logic or simple stemming (`nltk`, `spaCy`) to improve match quality

---

### 🧪 Example Pytest Cases

**`test_keyword_matcher.py`**

```python
from keyword_matcher import match_keywords

def test_exact_matches():
    resume = "Experienced in Python, Flask, and Docker."
    job = "Looking for someone skilled in Python and Docker."
    result = match_keywords(resume, job)
    assert result["matched"] == ["Python", "Docker"]
    assert result["missing"] == []

def test_missing_skills():
    resume = "Experienced in Python and SQL."
    job = "We need Python, AWS, and CI/CD experience."
    result = match_keywords(resume, job)
    assert set(result["matched"]) == {"Python"}
    assert set(result["missing"]) == {"AWS", "CI/CD"}

def test_empty_resume():
    resume = ""
    job = "Knowledge of Git and APIs required"
    result = match_keywords(resume, job)
    assert result["matched"] == []
    assert set(result["missing"]) == {"Git", "APIs"}
```

## 🤖 Project 2: AI Job Description Summarizer & Red Flag Detector

### 🌟 Project Goal

> User pastes a job description. The backend:

* Returns a 1–3 sentence summary
* Highlights common red flag phrases (e.g. “fast-paced,” “wear many hats,” “rockstar”)
* Explains what each red flag might imply

---

### 🔧 Backend Architecture (Python Flask or FastAPI)

* `POST /analyze_job_description`

  * Body: `{ "text": "..." }`
  * Returns:

    ```json
    {
      "summary": "This is a software engineering role in a startup environment.",
      "red_flags": [
        { "phrase": "fast-paced", "reason": "May imply long hours or stress" },
        { "phrase": "wear many hats", "reason": "Unclear responsibilities" }
      ]
    }
    ```

---

### 🔍 Red Flag Detection Logic

* **Red Flag List:** stored as dictionary or JSON:

  ```python
  RED_FLAGS = {
      "fast-paced": "May imply long hours or stress",
      "rockstar": "Unrealistic expectations",
      "wear many hats": "Unclear responsibilities"
  }
  ```
* **Summary Options:**

  * Basic: return first 2–3 sentences
  * Better: use `sumy`, `gensim`, or OpenAI API for true summarization

---

### 🧪 Example Pytest Cases

**`test_job_analyzer.py`**

```python
from job_analyzer import analyze_job_description

def test_red_flags_detected():
    text = "We are a fast-paced startup looking for a rockstar engineer to wear many hats."
    result = analyze_job_description(text)
    phrases = [flag["phrase"] for flag in result["red_flags"]]
    assert "fast-paced" in phrases
    assert "rockstar" in phrases
    assert "wear many hats" in phrases

def test_summary_exists():
    text = "This role involves working with our engineering team to improve APIs and infrastructure."
    result = analyze_job_description(text)
    assert "summary" in result
    assert isinstance(result["summary"], str)
    assert len(result["summary"]) > 0

def test_no_flags():
    text = "This role includes collaborating with a team of engineers to build new features."
    result = analyze_job_description(text)
    assert result["red_flags"] == []
```

---

## 🧰 Tools & Extras

* **Python NLP Libraries**: `nltk`, `spaCy`, `sumy`, or `textblob` (for simple use)
* **Testing Framework**: `pytest` (run via `pytest test_job_analyzer.py`)
* **Frontend Add-ons**: Tooltip hover explanations, filters for severity of red flags
